A professional Streamlit chatbot for the World Falls Prevention Guidelines project, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB and OpenAI LLM. This chatbot answers questions strictly from the guidelines, with clear citations and a robust, user-friendly interface.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r ChatBot/requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Add your OpenAI API key**
   - Create a file named `openai_key.txt` in the `ChatBot` folder (next to `config.py`).
   - Paste your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-...`) as the only line in that file.
   - This file is already in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed.
3. **Run the chatbot**
   ```sh
   cd ChatBot
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Ask questions!**
   - Enter your question in the input box.
   - The chatbot will answer using only the World Falls Guidelines (with sources shown).
   - All previous Q&A are visible, with the latest at the top.
   - Use the sidebar to adjust model/parameters or clear chat history.

- For any issues, check your API key and vector DB paths
