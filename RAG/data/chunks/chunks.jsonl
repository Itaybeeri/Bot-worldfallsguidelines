These guidelines were developed by the World Falls Task Force, which assembled 96 multidisciplinary experts from 39 countries across five continents, with representation from 36 scientific and academic societies. The World Guidelines for Falls aim to provide a framework and expert recommendations to healthcare and other professionals working with older adults on how to identify and assess the risk of falls. They recommend which interventions, alone or in combination, should be offered to older people as part of a person-centred approach to preventing and managing falls. Falls become increasingly common as we get older. People aged 65 and over have a 30% chance of falling at least once a year and this increases to a 50% chance of falling at least once a year 1 in those aged over 80. Although some falls may appear minor, the human impact of falling can be devastating for older people from a psychological and physical perspective. Falls can result in loss of confidence, loss of independence, pain, injury, depression and even death. The Global Burden of Disease study reported nearly 17 million years of life lost from falls in 2017. 2 The number of falls and related injuries is likely to increase, partly as the global population of older adults grows, but also because of the rising prevalence of multimorbidity and frailty. 3 It is therefore highly significant that falls experts from across the globe have come together to agree and document guidelines for healthcare professionals to use in the prevention and management of falls.

The worldwide multidisciplinary nature of this group of experts and stakeholders makes them truly ground-breaking and relevant for a global healthcare audience. Professor Nathalie van der Velde of Amsterdam University Medical Centres and Co-principal Author of the World Guidelines for Falls Prevention and Management for Older Adults: A Global Initiative , commented: The World Falls Guideline Task Force was created following discussions in 2019 to reflect new evidence in falls prevention and management and respond to current service challenges. Our expert group conducted research that identified gaps in and inconsistencies between the existing guidelines developed nationally and by specialist international bodies. This concluded that a new set of clinical practice guidelines should be developed to address these issues. We are proud to have created robust guidelines that will be internationally applicable and will help healthcare professionals around the world to prevent and manage falls in their older patients.’’ Professor Rowan Harwood, Editor of Age and Ageing j ournal, commented: We are delighted to publish the ‘World Guidelines for Falls Prevention and Management for Older Adults’ in the British Geriatrics Society’s academic journal, Age and Ageing . Publishing such guidelines for the benefit of clinicians worldwide in a prestigious, peer-reviewed journal brings them to the attention of a global audience, informing future policy, practice and commissioning decisions.

Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers undertook title, abstract, and full text screening independently. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardised spreadsheet and a narrative synthesis presented for each assessment tool. Results Among 2736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta-analyses. Reviews were primarily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were: Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual task assessments, single leg stance, functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that no single gait, balance or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty. Moderate evidence suggests gait speed can be useful in predicting falls and might be included as part of a comprehensive evaluation for older adults. Peer Review reports Background Over one-third of adults aged 65 years and older fall at least once a year [ 1 ]. Increasing age, frailty, comorbidity, impaired gait, muscle weakness, and impaired balance all contribute to the risk of falls [ 2 ]. Falls are a major cause of disability and constitute the leading cause of injury-related mortality in people aged above 75 years [ 3 ]. The importance of an individualised approach to screening, assessment, and intervention is emphasised across professional guidelines such as the Steadi Algorithm [ 4 ]. There is no clear consensus on the specific choice of fall assessment; however, professio", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "file_name": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "parent_id": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga", "chunk_index": 1}}

There is no clear consensus on the specific choice of fall assessment; however, professional guidelines state that adults at high risk should be able to access individually tailored multifactorial measures based on a comprehensive assessment [ 5 , 6 ]. This should include assessment of gait, balance, and motor function with targeted interventions to address any limitation since these domains are associated with an increased risk of falls [ 7 , 8 ]. Assessing these limitations could help to identify older adults at risk of falling and allow targeted intervention to reduce this risk. Multiple approaches to assess gait, balance, and functional mobility have been developed including the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and gait speed testing, such as the dual-task gait test. Although widely used across clinical practice, there appears to be little standardisation and difficulty determining the most appropriate tool [ 9 ]. Systematic reviews of individual tools have provided limited and conflicting evidence for a tool’s predictive ability, thus precluding the ability to make clear clinical recommendations [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. To this end, we performed an umbrella review to synthesize the findings across multiple systematic reviews to help develop recommendations for clinical practice. The aim of this umbrella review was to systematically review, critically appraise, and summarize the existing reviews on the use of assessment tools of gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls in older adults or distinguish fallers from non-fallers. This review is part of a larger initiative on behalf of the task force on global guidelines for falls in older adults (details available at https://worldfallsguidelines.com/ ) [ 14 ].

This paper presents a summary of the umbrella review for Working Group 1, and the findings will be fed into a wider consensus development process to develop key recommendations in the assessment and management of falls for older adults. Methods This umbrella review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) [ 15 ] and the protocol was previously registered on PROSPERO’s international online register of systematic-, rapid-, and umbrella reviews (PROSPERO CRD42020225101). Search strategy The electronic academic databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane database for Systematic Reviews were searched from inception to November 23rd, 2020. The searches search were then updated on April 20th, 2022. To ensure a broad review of available literature, no restrictions on publication date were applied. A comprehensive search strategy was developed with the support of a research librarian using a combination of medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and key words for the concepts of older adults, gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments, and falls prediction. Only studies in English were included. The full search strategy for MEDLINE is presented in Additional file 1 at the end of this document and this strategy was adapted for each of the included databases. The reference lists of included papers were also reviewed to identify any further relevant reviews for inclusion. Selection criteria Types of studies We included the following types of review studies: Narrative reviews, defined as reviews that may or may not present a systematic synthesis of findings from all individual studies included [ 16 ]; Systematic reviews without meta-analysis, defined as having an explicit reproducible methodology including a systematic search that aims to identify all studies that meet pre-specified eligibility criteria followed b", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "file_name": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "parent_id": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga", "chunk_index": 3}}

We excluded the following types of studies: conference abstracts, student theses, books, book chapters, and papers reporting empirical data from a single study rather than reviewing more than one study. Reviews which included technology-based instruments only were excluded, as there is another on-going systematic review on this topic from Working Group 8 of the task force on global guidelines for falls in older adults (PROSPERO CRD42021241177). Populations and settings We included reviews of empirical studies in older adults (women and/or men), aged 60 years or older, in any setting. Specifically, we included reviews in all the following settings: the community, and primary and secondary care settings, including long-term care institutions, rehabilitation, and acute hospital settings. We also included reviews that presented data from various age groups in case they presented data on a subgroup of older adults aged 60 years or above separately. Following this, we excluded reviews examining individuals exclusively younger than 60 years of age. Assessments Reviews that included validated assessments of gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls or to distinguish fallers from non-fallers. Outcomes Our primary outcome of interest was the prediction of falls. Secondary outcomes were as follows: reliability, validity including sensitivity, specificity, feasibility, and cost of the assessments.

Disagreements were resolved by the assessment of a third reviewer (GO). Full text articles were retrieved and screened independently by two reviewers (KR, DBJ) with disagreements resolved by the assessment of a third reviewer (GO). Data extraction Three reviewers (KR, DBJ, GO) extracted the data by using a pre-defined data extraction form developed specifically for this review. The following data were extracted: Review details : author(s), year of publication, country of lead author, type of participants, review objective, number of participants, age range of participants, mean age of participants, and proportion of women. Search details : sources searched, type of analysis (narrative review, systematic review without meta-analysis, or systematic review with meta-analysis), number of studies included in the review, design of studies included, and countries in which included studies were conducted. Critical appraisal : date range of included studies, critical appraisal tool(s) used in the review, and critical appraisal score. Gait, balance, and functional mobility tests assessed : fall prediction outcome, measurement of falls, predictive ability, reliability, validity (specificity, and sensitivity). Cost : any cost analysis conducted.

Data synthesis To provide key clinical and research recommendations on assessment tools for fall prevention, the findings were synthesised for the most commonly reported gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments. Due to the heterogeneity of the reviews with regards to participant characteristics, settings, and assessment protocols, it was not appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis. A narrative synthesis was conducted for each gait, balance, and functional mobility assessment that was reported by more than two review studies. The narrative synthesis was conducted based on the review type and quality, as well as the number of reviews addressing this assessment and the key findings. For each review, the results were interpreted to indicate whether the findings in relation to the assessment tool’s predictive ability for falls were favourable, not favourable, inconsistent, or unclear (if data could not be extracted). An overall summary for each assessment was then made based on the highest quality available evidence. The synthesis is presented in tabular format; in the tables, the studies are ordered based on their quality. Results Search results The literature search identified a total of 2736 potentially relevant records. Of these, 543 were duplicates. The titles and abstracts of the remaining 2213 records were screened. After excluding 2092 items in the screening, the full texts of 121 articles were assessed for eligibility. After excluding further 90 records (50 were not review papers; 18 did not assess falls; 9 were technology-based instruments only; 7 were duplicate records; 5 were not in older adults; and 1 was not in English), we included 31 records in our analyses.

Three were categorised as narrative reviews, 17 as systematic reviews without meta-analysis, and 11 were systematic reviews with meta-analyses. Nine reviews reported on community dwelling older adults only, one reported on long term care settings only, one reported on emergency department settings only, and 13 reported studies across a range of settings including community, supported living, residential care, outpatient and inpatient settings. Four reviews provided no details on settings. Three reviews reported that they included older adults with cognitive impairment. Healthy community-dwelling older people were the primary focus of reviews however older people with neurological disorders were included in one review [ 33 ], older people receiving inpatient stroke rehabilitation were included in one review [ 35 ], and older people being assessed in the emergency department was the focus of one review [ 27 ].

Areas of high or unclear risk of bias primarily related to limiting searches with language restrictions, selection and data extraction not done in duplicate, and a lack of quality appraisal of the individual studies.

Timed up and go The TUG consists of a combination of standing from a chair and walking 3 m, turning and returning to sitting [ 45 ]. The TUG test was reported in thirteen reviews (Table 3 ). Three reviews demonstrated favourable findings [ 9 , 12 , 29 ], four reviews reported unclear or inconsistent findings [ 24 , 26 , 27 , 35 ], five reviews demonstrated not favourable findings [ 10 , 13 , 20 , 38 , 42 ], and one review reported no extractable data on TUG’s ability to predict falls [ 19 ]. Across all review studies, the evidence was inconsistent on the ability of the TUG to predict falls. There is some evidence, however, from some subgroup analysis that the TUG may have a role in fall prediction for the lower functioning older adult population [ 13 , 38 ].

One review did not report any results to extract [ 20 ]. Across all the review papers, the evidence for using the BBS to predict falls was inconsistent, and based on the best available evidence [ 11 , 42 ], the use of the BBS as a balance assessment used in isolation is not recommended to predict falls. There was some evidence from one review that the BBS may have a predictive role in a stroke clinic population [ 29 ]. Gait speed Gait speed is the measurement of the time it takes to complete a walk over a given distance in the participant’s preferred or maximum pace [ 47 , 48 ] and was reported in ten review papers (Table 5 ). Seven reviews demonstrated positive findings [ 22 , 26 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 35 , 41 ]. One reported low sensitivity on the ability of gait speed to predict falls in community dwelling older adults [ 29 ], and one reported that a timed walk was not an independent predictor of falls in long term care settings [ 35 ]. One review reported that gait speed did not predict falls in cognitive impaired older adults, however a subgroup analysis showed evidence for gait speed predicting falls [ 38 ]. One review reported no data to extract [ 19 ]. Different distances were used across the studies including 4, 6, 10, and up to 25 m distances. Two reviews investigated usual gait speed [ 22 , 34 ]. One review reported mainly preferred walking speed [ 41 ]. One review reported that of the eight studies that assessed gait speed, six found slow gait speed under standard conditions to predict falls [ 38 ].

Dual task assessments Dual task assessments are the combination of a physical task (such as walking) and either a second physical task (such as holding an object) or a cognitive task (such as counting) [ 49 ] and was reported in seven review papers (Table 6 ). In detail, four reviews demonstrated favourable findings [ 24 , 32 , 41 ], two review reported unclear findings [ 23 , 37 ], and one review demonstrated not favourable findings on the ability of dual task testing to predict falls [ 36 ]. Evidence for the ability of dual task testing to predict falls over single balance tests was inconsistent; however, the best available evidence suggested that dual task testing had the ability to predict falls.

One review paper demonstrated favourable results [ 9 ], 3 papers reported unclear results [ 19 , 35 , 38 ],, and one review reported inconsistent findings on the ability of the CST to predict falls [ 39 ]. Overall, the evidence was inconsistent for the ability of CST to predict falls. Table 11 Summary table of the chair stand test as a falls assessment tool Full size table Discussion Summary This umbrella review aimed to systematically and critically appraise the evidence on gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments used to predict falls for older adults. A total of 31 review papers were identified, which were mainly systematic reviews without meta-analysis and of low quality with high risk of bias. There were inconsistencies in the findings across all the review papers. The present umbrella review determined that there is not one single gait, balance, and functional mobility assessment that can be used in isolation to predict falls in community-dwelling older adults. The TUG was the most frequently assessed single test for falls prediction, but the findings were inconsistent in its ability to predict falls. There is, however, favourable evidence to suggest that gait speed can be useful in predicting falls and might be included as part of a comprehensive evaluation for older adults. Some positive results were found in dual task assessment as predictors of falls. Wider context Clinical practice guidelines recommend multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community dwelling older adults who are at an increased risk of falls [ 6 , 14 , 54 , 55 ]. Such interventions contain an initial assessment of risk factors for falls and subsequent customised interven", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "file_name": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga.txt", "parent_id": "Predicting falls in older adults_ an umbrella review of instruments assessing ga", "chunk_index": 12}}

Such interventions contain an initial assessment of risk factors for falls and subsequent customised interventions for each patient based on risk factors [ 56 ]. The inconsistencies reported across the included review papers highlight the importance of making a clinical judgement including risk factors such as previous falls, cognitive impairment, comorbidity, polypharmacy, activities of daily living, psychological factors, vision impairment, cognitive impairment, and footwear [ 1 , 2 ]. Clinicians are encouraged to consider individual needs and contexts when evaluating falls risk in older adults. The inconsistencies reported across the review papers of the present umbrella review may have been influenced by the wide range of settings and clinical characteristics included in the individual studies. It is thus challenging to make recommendations for specific settings using the evidence from this review, in light of the degree of heterogeneity across the evidence available. Based on the evidence from this review, we are unable to recommend using the Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, Chair Stand Test, One Leg Stand, or Functional Reach, alone as single tests for the prediction of falls in older adults. We acknowledge however that these tests have value in assessing mobility and balance limitations and in identifying appropriate targeted interventions. In post stroke patients, one review reported positive results on the BBS for fall prediction [ 29 ], whereas the Functional Reach Test showed positive results in populations with cognitive impairments [ 26 ]. Gait speed appeared most promising in fall prediction and has also been associated with other important outcomes like survival and functional capacity [ 22 ]. Gait speed is a simple measurement, with no need for expensive equipment and can be performed quickly.

Gait speed is a simple measurement, with no need for expensive equipment and can be performed quickly. The favourable findings in this review indicate gait speed is feasible to complete for community-dwelling older people and older outpatients of stroke clinics. However, gait speed should be assessed through a clearly defined protocol, which specifies the distances to walk or the time allocated to walking, and whether participants walk at their usual speed or maximum speed. One review suggested that the assessment at usual pace gait speed over 4 m might represent a highly reliable instrument to be implemented [ 22 ]. Given the number of older people who could benefit from fall risk assessment, an inexpensive assessment tool that can be used in different settings is appealing. Dual task assessments showed promise in its ability to predict falls, with some evidence suggesting that it was a better predictor of falls than single task assessments [ 32 ]. But importantly, differences in testing protocols could have influenced the results, warranting future research with standardised protocols to allow further synthesis of this finding. The findings from the present umbrella review demonstrate that it is feasible to complete an assessment of gait speed in older adults across a range of settings including the community, long-term care institutions, and rehabilitation settings. Based on the assessment of the falls risk, it is important that interventions are offered to reduce this risk. Exercise programmes have been demonstrated to reduce the rate of falls, particularly for community-dwelling older adults; the most effective programmes include balance and functional mobility exercises [ 57 ]. The TUG was the most frequently reported assessment for falls prediction.

The TUG is a simple and low-cost test that is easy to administer and has been previously recommended in clinical practice guidelines including the guidelines posited by the American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society (AGS/BGS) [ 54 , 58 ]. However, this umbrella review demonstrated that its fall predictive ability was inconsistent. This inconsistency may be explained by heterogeneity in the settings and populations studied, the use of different cut-off times, and the mixed quality of the evidence. One review suggested that the TUG may have a role in predicting falls in lower functioning or institutionalized older adults [ 13 ]. Strengths and limitations To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first umbrella review examining gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments in the prediction of falls for older adults. Further strengths of this umbrella review included following PRISMA reporting guidelines [ 15 ], conducting a comprehensive search for evidence with the support of a research librarian, and clearly stating the objectives beforehand and ensuring transparency with the published protocol. Furthermore, the selection of the included studies was performed in duplicate with a third reviewer resolving any conflicts. The reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies in pairs, using a quality assessment tool designed specifically to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews, and differences were discussed and resolved between reviewers. However, this umbrella review has some limitations. The included studies were too heterogeneous to allow for direct comparison of results in a united meta-analysis. In addition, studies involved both prospectively and retrospectively reported falls, which might have contributed to some of the heterogeneity. Also, many of the included review studies were considered to have a high or unclear risk of bias with a lack of clear reporting.

Also, many of the included review studies were considered to have a high or unclear risk of bias with a lack of clear reporting. This limited the data that could be extracted and synthesised. The differences in the included studies were not statistically assessed, following advice from a statistician that it was not possible to do so, due to heterogeneity between studies. We excluded review papers that were not available in English due to the resources available for the review, therefore, it is possible that the language restriction in the selection of the included studies may have affected the results by introducing a risk of selection bias. We chose to exclude grey literature (e.g., papers that are not published in peer-reviewed journals) to ensure a certain level of quality in the included studies. In this umbrella review no differentiation between falls, multiple fallers or injurious falls were made. It was not possible from the umbrella review to provide guidance on the critical level of performance in gait speed associated with higher risk of falling. The optimal cut-off in gait speed to predict falls has not been universally defined and accepted, although different cut-offs (eg 1 m/s, 0.8 m/s, 0.6 m/s) have been associated with various adverse health outcomes, including falls. Based on a systematic literature review, an International Academy on Nutrition and Ageing (IANA) expert panel advised to assess GS at usual pace over 4 m and to use the easy-to-remember cut-off point of 0.8 m/s to predict the risk of adverse outcomes [ 22 ]. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was included in the search terms for this review; however, it was only reported in one review [ 26 ], limiting the ability to draw conclusions about its predictive ability in this review.

In 2018, the SPPB has been accepted by the European Medical Agency as an assessment tool to assess frailty. In addition, as the SPPB is widely used in geriatric and other medical fields, it is gaining importance. Single studies reported mixed results with regards to fall prediction [ 59 , 60 ]. Therefore, future research investigating its ability to predict falls and injurious falls is urgently needed. Further studies are required to investigate the applicability and validity of fall risk assessment tests in different populations with varying functional levels. Different frailty or intrinsic capacity status may influence the fall predictive ability of these tests. Older frailer adults with cognitive or physical impairment may not be able to perform hazardous tasks or follow complex instructions. Low resource settings may lack the equipment and trained staff to perform the more sophisticated tests, despite their potential effectiveness. We acknowledge that assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility may form only one part of an assessment of falls prediction. Falls prediction approaches may need to further account for the multifactorial nature of falls and the extensive list of factors that can contribute to the risk of falling. The development of multifactorial falls prediction models is an area of ongoing research; however, further work is required before their widespread use is advocated [ 61 ]. Conclusions Overall, there is not one single gait, balance, and functional mobility assessment alone that can be used in isolation to predict fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. The best available evidence suggests that gait speed is a useful measure in predicting falls and should be considered as part of a comprehensive evaluation of fall risk for older adults.

Methods and analysis This systematic review protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A systematic search was performed in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO (2 November 2020). We will also search in trial registers. We will include randomised controlled trials, in which any deprescribing intervention is compared with usual care and reports falls as an outcome. Both title and abstract screening and full-text screening will be done by two reviewers. The Cochrane Collaboration revised tool of Risk of Bias will be applied to perform risk of bias assessment. We will categorise the results separately for every setting. If a group of sufficiently comparable studies will be identified, we will perform a meta-analysis applying random effects model. We will investigate heterogeneity using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the χ 2 test and the I 2 statistic results. We have prespecified several subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not applicable for this study since no original data will be collected. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations. Furthermore, this systematic review will inform the recommendations of working group of polypharmacy and FRIDs of the anticipated World’s Falls Guidelines.

We will use the rigorous methodology in accordance with the Cochrane handbook and the results will be reported as stated by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The search algorithm was developed by an experienced librarian and customised to four large databases. No language restriction will be applied in the selection of the studies. The certainty of the evidence of this systematic review may be limited by the limited number of studies available and the possible low quality of the individual studies.

Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses have aimed to summarise the evidence-related to deprescribing as a single intervention. 6 8–11 A comparison of the conclusions of these systematic reviews is difficult due to the variation in included trials in the different reviews. The trials performed in long-term care settings or hospitals were summarised by Cameron et al in 2018. 9 They concluded that general medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling in long term care facilities. In addition, they identified only one deprescribing intervention study that was performed in a hospital. Furthermore, the Cochrane review by Gillespie et al in 2012 assessing fall prevention approaches in community-dwelling older adults identified a total of five studies investigating medication withdrawal as a single intervention. 8 Two of the five included studies found an effect of the intervention.

Page et al found in 2016 in their meta-analysis that deprescribing led to fewer falls overall but did not significantly improve the risk of experiencing at least one fall. 11 However, very heterogeneous trials were pooled together from placebo-controlled psychotropics withdrawal in primary care to education programme regarding appropriate medication use for physicians in nursing homes. Furthermore, Hart et al concluded in 2020 that reducing FRIDs use as a stand-alone intervention may not be effective. 6 However, only studies performed in older adults presenting with a fall‐related injury or a history of falls were included in the review. The most recent meta-analysis on this topic by Lee et al found no effect of FRIDs deprescribing on fall outcomes. 10 However, all studies assessing medication reviews and management with a broader focus on reducing polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate prescribing were excluded. Thus, a comprehensive update of the literature focusing on all deprescribing interventions including medication reviews with broader focus is warranted to enhance current knowledge as important deprescribing trials have been published in recent years. Therefore, our aim is to perform a systematic review concerning the effectiveness of deprescribing (eg, including general medication reviews or FRIDs deprescribing) as a single intervention in falls prevention performed in any setting in which older people receive healthcare. Furthermore, we aim to report the results separately for each setting and perform a meta-analysis if sufficiently comparable studies will be identified.

Eligibility criteria Type of studies Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-randomised trials (eg, allocation by alternation), cluster-randomised trials and trials in which treatment allocations are inadequately concealed, will be included. We will include studies without language restriction. Types of participants Trials will be considered for inclusion if they included participants aged ≥60 years or if the majority of participants are aged >65 years or the mean age is >65 years. We will include trials from all settings, for example, community, hospital ward, long-term care facilities. Type of interventions The intervention can be any deprescribing intervention. ‘Deprescribing’ has been described as ‘the process of withdrawal of an (inappropriate) medication, supervised by a health care professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes’. 12 The interventions can be, for example, pharmacist-led medication reviews, physician-led interventions, prescriber education programmes, multidisciplinary interventions or clinical decision support systems. The intervention can target specific drug classes (eg, psychotropics) or general medication regimen (ie, comprehensive medication review). The intervention might target multiple medication issues in case of comprehensive medication review in addition to withdrawal such as polypharmacy, non-adherence, education and starting medications. If deprescribing intervention is a part of a multi-modal intervention (eg, including an exercise component in addition to deprescribing), the study will be excluded.

Our secondary outcome is injurious falls (eg, fall-related fractures, fall-related hospital admissions or fall-related healthcare use). Information sources A systematic search was performed in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to search for literature published from onset until 2 November 2020 which will be updated to prior manuscript submission. A customised search strategy was conducted for each database. We will also search in trial registers.

If data to be extracted are missing, incomplete or unclear, inquiries will be sent to the authors. Effect measures We will report the treatment effects between the intervention and control group as a rate ratio (RaR), a risk tatio (RR) and/or a HR and accompanying 95% Cls. For rate of falls, we will use RaR as a treatment effect measure and the rate is the total number of falls per unit of person time that falls were monitored. We will use the unadjusted RaR, unless the adjustment is performed due to clustering. Furthermore, if needed due to missing reporting, we will calculate RaR from appropriate raw data if possible. For dichotomous outcomes for example, fallers or frequent fallers, we will use RR as a treatment effect measure. We will use the unadjusted RR, unless the adjustment is performed due to clustering. Furthermore, if needed due to missing reporting or if OR is reported, we will calculate RR from the raw data if possible. For survival time-to-event data, we will use HR as a treatment effect measure. We will use the unadjusted HR, unless the adjustment is performed due to clustering. Furthermore, we will adjust for clustering, if not already done in the published report using intra-cluster coefficient estimates and average cluster size.

In case of disagreement, a third reviewer will be consulted. The tool covers five domains: bias arising from randomisation process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in measurement of outcome, bias in selection of the reported result. In addition, an additional domain is available for cluster randomised trials; bias arising from identification or recruitment of individual participants within clusters. Each domain has signalling questions aiming to elicit relevant information. Responses to these questions are fed into algorithms to score each domain either low risk of bias, some concerns or high risk of bias. The scores of each domain are further mapped into overall risk-of-bias-judgement including categories of low risk of bias, some concerns and high risk of bias. Data synthesis We will categorise the results separately for every setting (eg, community, hospital or long-term care facilities) due to the different participant and environment characteristics. First, a narrative synthesis will be provided in the text and tables to summarise the study characteristics and results. If a group of studies with a sufficiently comparable intervention and outcome and performed in the same setting is identified, we will perform a meta-analysis applying the intention-to-treat principle. For example, a study purely investigating antihypertensive withdrawal will not be pooled with a study purely investigating antidepressant withdrawal. The results will be pooled using a random-effects model considering the expected heterogeneity between the studies. We will try to minimise the heterogeneity by grouping the trials by setting and similar intervention. We will investigate remaining heterogeneity within a pooled group of trials using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the χ 2 test (with st", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness o.txt", "file_name": "Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness o.txt", "parent_id": "Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness o", "chunk_index": 10}}

We will investigate remaining heterogeneity within a pooled group of trials using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the χ 2 test (with statistical significance set at p<0.10), and the I 2 statistic results according to the recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook. We will explore heterogeneity by conducting a subgroup analysis based on the following: (a) age, (b) whether the trial is targeted to known fallers (or recurrent fallers if applicable) or also to non-fallers, (c) healthcare professionals conducting the medication review, for example, by physician or pharmacist, (d) whether the medication review is done with the help of a prescribing tool, for example, STOPP/START or the Beers criteria and which tool is used and (e) population, for example, if the trial is conducted only in dementia patients in comparison to general nursing home population. We will perform a sensitivity analysis according to overall study quality; low risk of bias, some concerns and high risk of bias, by comparing random and fixed-effect model and by excluding possible outlying studies, if the visual inspection of the forest plot shows poorly overlapping CIs. We will explore the possibility of publication bias by constructing funnel plots and by conducting Egger’s test for analyses that contain more than 10 studies.

Discussion Although FRIDs use is an important risk factor for falls, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of deprescribing interventions as a single intervention in falls prevention in older people. Identifying effective falls prevention interventions is of importance, considering the burden-related to fall injuries to both individuals and society. This systematic review will help update the knowledge on the effectiveness of deprescribing, since we aim to create the most comprehensive systematic review to date by exploring all settings in which older people receive healthcare and all deprescribing interventions. In addition, we will use rigorous methodology in accordance with the Cochrane handbook and the results will be reported as stated by PRISMA statement. Therefore, we will provide relevant knowledge that will be implemented into anticipated World’s Falls Guidelines and may influence future clinical practice. However, the certainty of the evidence of this systematic review may be limited by the limited number of studies available and the possible low quality of the individual studies.

Methods A systematic search in PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science (core collection), and Cochrane Library was performed and updated on the 25th of August, 2022. Studies reporting on the evaluation of implementation strategies for multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community setting were included. Two reviewers independently performed the search, screening, data extraction, and synthesis process (PRISMA flow diagram). The quality of the included reports was appraised by means of a sensitivity analysis, assessing the relevance to the research question and the methodological quality (Mixed Method Appraisal Tool). Implementation strategies were reported according to Proctor et al.’s (2013) guideline for specifying and reporting implementation strategies and the Taxonomy of Behavioral Change Methods of Kok et al.

All studies combined implementation strategies, addressing different determinants. The most frequently used implementation strategies at individual level were “tailoring,” “active learning,” “personalize risk,” “individualization,” “consciousness raising,” and “participation.” At environmental level, the most often described strategies were “technical assistance,” “use of lay health workers, peer education,” “increasing stakeholder influence,” and “forming coalitions.” The included studies did not describe the implementation strategies in detail, and a variety of labels for implementation strategies were used.

Conclusions This review highlights gaps in the detailed description of implementation strategies and the effective use of implementation frameworks, models, and theories. The review found that studies mainly focused on implementation strategies at the level of the older person and healthcare professional, emphasizing the importance of “tailoring,” “consciousness raising,” and “participation” in the implementation process. Studies describing implementation strategies at the level of the organization, community, and policy/society show that “technical assistance,” “actively involving stakeholders,” and “forming coalitions” are important strategies. Trial registration PROSPERO CRD42020187450 Peer Review reports Contribution to the literature There is still a knowledge gap in how to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions into clinical practice. The implementation strategies most frequently used at individual level were “tailoring,” “active learning,” “personalize risk,” “individualization,” “consciousness raising,” and “participation.” The implementation strategies most often mentioned at environmental level were “technical assistance,” “use of lay health workers, peer education,” “increasing stakeholder influence,” and “forming coalitions.” The included studies mainly focused on implementation strategies at the level of the older person and healthcare professional. This review recommends using taxonomies and reporting guidelines to select and describe implementation strategies. Show more Background Falls are a major problem in community-dwelling older persons due to their prevalence and consequences. One-third of the older persons living at home (65+) fall annually [ 1 ].

One-third of the older persons living at home (65+) fall annually [ 1 ]. Each year, there are 684,000 fatal falls and 37.3 million falls that require medical treatment globally [ 2 ]. With an aging population, these numbers will continue to rise [ 2 , 3 ]. A fall is defined as “an unexpected event in which the older person comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level” [ 4 ]. Each fall is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and can often lead to physical (e.g., bruises, lacerations, fractures) and psychosocial (e.g., social isolation, fear of falling, depression) consequences [ 5 ]. In the USA, falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among persons aged 65 and over [ 6 ]. Falls and its related injuries have also a substantial impact on the healthcare cost and the economic burden of society [ 7 ]. Consequently, the implementation of effective falls prevention interventions not only may benefit the older person, but it can also reduce the economic burden of society, as shown in literature [ 8 ]. Falling is complex, and many factors contribute to its risk (e.g., mobility impairment, medication use, and home hazards) [ 9 ]. Due to this complexity, many guidelines recommend to use multifactorial falls prevention interventions [ 9 , 10 ]. These interventions consist of two or more components tailored to the individual fall-risk profile of the older person [ 11 ]. A person older than 65 years is at risk of falling if he or she presents with a fall, reports at least one injurious fall or two or more noninjuries falls, or reports or displays unsteady gait or balance [ 9 , 12 , 13 ]. An older person with high risk of falling receives an assessment of risk factors, i.e., an evaluation of risk factors. Based on the individual fall-risk profile, the person receives an intervention (e.g., one person can receive exercise in combination with recommendations for home hazards; another person can obtain medication advice and", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 3}}

A Cochrane review supports the “efficacy” of those multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community setting; it can reduce the rate of falls with 23% compared to usual care or attention control ( RaR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87) [ 11 ]. Despite the evidence for the efficacy of these interventions, recent pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trials, exploring the “effectiveness” of multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community, found that there is no effect on rate of falls, fall-related injuries, and fractures [ 14 , 15 ]. It is likely that these differences in results between efficacy and effectiveness testing are due to a poor translation and implementation of multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community [ 16 ]. It is key to address important implementation issues such as the barriers and facilitators (determinants) and select suitable strategies at different levels of the context (i.e., older person, healthcare professional, organization, community, policy/society) to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community setting (i.e., “home or places of residence that do not provide residential health-related care”) [ 11 , 17 , 18 ]. Currently, research on the implementation of multifactorial falls prevention interventions rarely assesses determinants and derives appropriate implementation strategies (i.e., “a method or technique designed to enhance adoption of a ‘clinical’ intervention”) [ 19 ]. In addition, clear and transparent reporting of implementation strategies is scarce [ 16 , 20 ].

This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the strategies used to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community. Methods The review protocol was designed and reported following the PRISMA 2020 statement [ 21 ]. This protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020187450) [ 22 ]. The methodology and the main findings of this review were discussed with a multidisciplinary group of 21 stakeholders (e.g., physiotherapists, geriatrician, pharmacist, occupational therapist, registered nurses, policy makers, representatives of older persons, researchers). Purposive sampling was used to compose the stakeholder group (e.g., multidisciplinary group, knowledge about falls prevention, experience with implementation projects in the community). The group met two times to discuss the research question, the included articles, and the results. Searches The search strategy was developed in collaboration with the Biomedical Library, 2Bergen of the University of Leuven, Belgium. The search strategy consisted of three concepts: “older person,” “falls prevention,” and “community setting” (Additional file 1 ). The search was performed in five databases: PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science (core collection), and Cochrane Library. The original search was performed from inception until the 18th of May, 2020. On the 25th of August 2022, the researchers updated the search. One researcher (SAV) removed all duplicates in EndNote™, following the de-duplication method of Bramer et al. (2016) [ 23 ]. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two independent reviewers (SAV and JP/GB) screened the titles and abstracts of the records. The reviewers discussed potentially relevant records. After discussion, two reviewers (SAV and SIV/GB) independently read and assessed the reports for eligibility. The reviewers once again discussed the selection process.

The selection process was performed in the webtool Rayyan™ and mapped following the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram [ 21 , 24 ]. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria An overview of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Table 1 . Studies reporting on the evaluation of implementation strategies for multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community setting were included [ 19 ]. Multiple publications pertaining the same study were taken into account.

This analysis took into account the relevance to the research question and the methodological quality of the reports. Table 2 gives an insight in how the sensitivity analysis was assessed. This sensitivity analysis was used to detect reports with a high contribution to the review and high methodological quality, which served as a starting point in the data synthesis (Table 2 ) [ 25 , 26 ].

(3) Is the evaluation of an implementation strategy for multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community described? (4) Does the report measure the effectiveness of the implementation strategy? (5) Does the report explore the experiences with the strategy for the implementation of multifactorial falls prevention interventions? Based on these items, the relevance of the included reports was scored low, moderate, or high (Additional file 2 ). The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included reports [ 49 ]. The MMAT is designed to appraise methodological quality in systematic mixed studies reviews. The methodological quality of five designs can be appraised: qualitative research, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized studies, quantitative descriptive studies, and mixed methods studies [ 49 ]. The tool starts with two screening questions: [1] Are there clear research questions? and [2] Do the collected data allow to address the research questions? The MMAT indicates that further appraisal is not feasible when the answer is “no” or “cannot tell” on one or both screening questions. After the screening questions, the methodological quality of the included reports was assessed based on the study design. For each study design, five specific criteria needed to be rated. The detailed criteria for each design can be found in additional file 2 [ 49 ]. The quality of the included reports was scored low, moderate, or high. Data extraction strategy Two reviewers (SAV and MH/JM/GB) independently extracted study characteristics as follows: year, citation, country, source of funding, aim, design, setting, recruitment strategy, sample size, methods of investigation, and analysis. The reviewers also collected data on the characteristics of the target population: age, gender, type of healthcare professional, type of patient, family members, and informal caregiver.

In addition, information on the implementation strategies, the multifactorial falls prevention interventions, and follow-up were collected. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist (TIDIeR) was used to describe the multifactorial falls prevention interventions and implementation strategies [ 50 ]. All data were compiled in Microsoft Excel™. Data synthesis and presentation Data were summarized in evidence tables, and a narrative synthesis was performed following the “Guidance on the conduct of Narrative synthesis in Systematic Reviews” [ 51 ]. To improve conceptual clarity and comprehensiveness, two independent researchers (SAV and GB) synthesized for each report the implementation strategies for the different levels of the context (i.e., older person, healthcare professional, organization, community, policy/society) following the Proctor et al.’s (2013) recommendations for specifying and reporting implementation strategies and Kok et al.’s (2016) Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods: an Intervention Mapping approach [ 18 , 52 , 53 ]. The taxonomy of behaviour change methods makes a distinction between behaviour change methods at individual and environmental level [ 53 ]. The individual level corresponds to the older person and healthcare professionals. The organization, community, and policy/society are part of the environmental level of the taxonomy. The classification used in this review conforms to the Intervention Mapping approach [ 18 ]. The taxonomy of behaviour change methods is part of Intervention Mapping, and it is developed by the same authors [ 18 , 53 ]. The research group chose to use this taxonomy due to its clear links to theory and determinants of practice for its interventions; it states that a behaviour change method is effective if it meets three conditions: [1] the", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 8}}

In addition, the taxonomy of Per Nilsen was used to categorize the implementation theories, models, and frameworks used in the included reports [ 54 ]. The reviewers discussed the synthesis, and discrepancies were resolved by consulting the research group (KM, BDdC, EV, and JF). Results The search strategy resulted in a total of 17,407 records, totaling 9280 unique records, after the duplicates were removed. The screening of title and abstract excluded another 9110 records. The full texts of 170 reports were read, of which 83 were found eligible. Eleven additional reports were identified by hand searching fifteen relevant literature reviews and by citation tracking of the eligible reports. In total, 94 reports described the implementation of single, multicomponent, or multifactorial falls prevention interventions. Due to the complexity and the different risk factors that contribute to the risk of falling, the research group and stakeholder group decided to make an amendment to the protocol and to only include reports implementing multifactorial falls prevention interventions. This resulted in the exclusion of 45 reports. After screening the included reports, the researchers and stakeholders noted that some reports ( n = 11) did not describe or evaluate the implementation strategies. Therefore, it was decided to add the following new inclusion criteria to the protocol: the implementation strategies needed to be described, reports exploring the experiences, and perceptions and needs of the target group were only included if it was primary research.

In addition, literature showed that education alone is not sufficient for behaviour change [ 55 ]. As a result, an additional exclusion criteria was formulated. Due to the specificity and the complexity of certain diseases like multiple sclerosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, the research group decided not to focus on a specific patient population. Based on all these adaptations, 71 reports were excluded. In total, 23 reports (18 studies) were included in this systematic review [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. A full description of the identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process is outlined in the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram Full size image Study quality assessment The majority of the reports scored high ( n = 18), and five scored moderate on the relevance to the research question. The methodological quality of the reports was in general moderate ( n = 16); four reports scored low and three high. No reports were excluded based on the methodological quality. Based on these ratings, the relative contribution (sensitivity analysis) of the reports could be appraised (Table 2 ). In total, fourteen reports scored high and nine moderate on the sensitivity analysis. Due to the heterogeneity in terms of study design, setting, multifactorial falls prevention interventions, and implementation strategies and outcomes, the extent to which data could be synthesized was limited. Therefore, the results of the sensitivity analysis could not be taken into account in the data synthesis (i.e., giving more weight to reports with a higher score on relevance to the research question and methodological quality).

Description of implementation strategies The majority of the studies described implementation strategies on multiple levels of the context (i.e., older person, healthcare professional, organization, community, policy/society) ( n = 15) [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Renehan et al. (2019), Milisen et al. (2006), and Gholamzadeh et al. (2021) only focused on implementation strategies at the level of the older person [ 32 , 38 , 40 ]. Six studies (seven reports) reported on “Stepping On,” a multifaceted community-based program using a small group learning environment [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 ]. One study explored the use of iSOLVE (Integrated SOLutions for sustainable falls preVEntion), which consisted of a decision tool for GPs with referrals to other healthcare professionals, a stay independent fall checklist, GP fall risk assessment, and a list of recommended, individualized, and tailored falls prevention interventions [ 29 ]. Two studies described a nurse-led multifactorial falls prevention intervention [ 38 , 42 ]. One study (five reports) reported on “Stay On your Feet,” a large multi strategic program (e.g., awareness raising, education, polic", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 12}}

One study (five reports) reported on “Stay On your Feet,” a large multi strategic program (e.g., awareness raising, education, policy change) [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. Two studies used “Chronic Disease Management” as part of Medicare (formerly Enhanced Primary Care), allowing a general practitioner (GP) to plan and coordinate care for patients with chronic diseases and patients who need multidisciplinary care from a GP and at least two other healthcare professionals [ 30 , 39 ]. One study described a posthospital tailored multifactorial falls prevention intervention [ 32 ], and another study reported on a community-based approach [ 47 ]. Four studies described a program that contained external support for implementation (i.e., financial support, support for implementation, and/or training from the research group) [ 17 , 43 , 44 , 46 ]. No studies described taxonomies or guidelines to report their implementation strategies. Figure 2 gives an overview of the implementation strategies following the “Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods; an Intervention Mapping Approach”; a distinction is made between behaviour change methods at individual and environmental level [ 18 , 53 ]. Some strategies were not only found at individual level but also at the level of the organization, community, and policy/society. An extensive overview of the implementation strategies used in the included reports can be found in additional file 3 . Fig. 2 Implementation strategies Full size image Individual level According to the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods, the implementation strategies identified in the included reports aimed to change the following determinants at individual level: “knowledge,” “awareness and risk perception,” ‘habitual, automatic and impulsive behaviors,” “attitudes, beliefs, outcome expectations,” “social influence,” “skills, capabilities and self-efficacy,” and “public stigma” [ 53 ].

In total, 26 implementation strategies were identified across eighteen studies (Fig. 2 ). The most frequently mentioned implementation strategies at individual level were as follows: tailoring ( n = 18), active learning ( n = 17), personalize risk ( n = 16), individualization ( n = 12), consciousness raising ( n = 11), and participation ( n = 10). The Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods defined tailoring as matching the intervention or components to previously measured characteristics of the participant [ 53 ] . All reports used tailoring [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Personalize risk entails providing information about personal costs or risks of action or inaction with respect to target behavior [ 53 ]. Sixteen studies used personalize risk as an implementation strategy [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Tailoring and personalize risk are crucial parts of multifactorial falls prevention interventions, in which two or more components are tailored to the individual fall risk profile of the older person [ 11 ]. Tailoring was also used at the level of the healthcare professional ( n = 9) (e.g., development of tailored tools like referral pads, screening instruments, and tools to plan falls prevention interventions) [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 48 ] and by three studies at the level of the organization (e.g., tailored implementation manual) [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 44 , 46 ]. Seventeen studies [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] described active learning (i.e., encouraging learning from goal driven and activity b", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 14}}

Active learning was mostly used at the level of the older person and healthcare professionals. Some examples are “Stepping On” [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 ], “Stay On Your Feet” [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ], and the “Connecticut Collaboration for Fall Prevention intervention” [ 17 , 46 ]. “Stepping On” ( n = 6) used a small group learning environment and incorporated a variety of learning strategies to increase knowledge and competencies (i.e., adult learning principles) [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 ]. In “Stay On Your Feet,” active learning was part of the community education in which local people were trained as community educators. In addition, older persons were recruited and trained to fulfill three roles: [1] falls prevention advisors [2], home safety advisors, and [3] medication advisors [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. Two studies described the “Connecticut Collaboration for Fall Prevention intervention” that consisted of a multidisciplinary team that trained and encouraged professional behavioral change of healthcare professionals in home health agencies or senior centers [ 17 , 46 ]. Six studies did not describe the techniques that were used in the educational part of the programs [ 29 , 32 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 44 ]. Individualization is defined as providing opportunities for learners to have personal questions answered or instructions paced according to their individual progress [ 53 ]. Individualization was used in twelve studies at the level of the older person, manifesting in follow-up of recommendations [ 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 45 , 46 , 48 ]. In total, eleven studies [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] used consciousness raisi", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 15}}

(2006) [ 38 ] raised consciousness among older persons by using healthcare professionals to inform the older persons about their fall risk factors. Although Kok and colleagues categorized consciousness raising only at the individual level, the intervention was also identified at the levels of the organizations, community, policy/society [ 53 ]. Examples for these levels are “Stay On Your Feet” and the study of Kittipimpanon et al. (2012) [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 47 ]. In “Stay On Your Feet,” mass media strategies (i.e., television advertisement, local newspapers, local radio) were used to increase public interest [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. Kittipimpanon and colleagues developed a yearly campaign that consisted of advertisement for their falls prevention program (e.g., polo shirts, stickers) [ 47 ]. Participation is described as ‘assuring high level engagement of the participants’ group in problem-solving, decision-making, and change activities; with highest level being control by the participants’ group [ 53 ]. In total, ten studies described strategies that fit this definition. Participation is mostly used at the level of the older person [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Participation was an important implementation strategy in “Stepping On” [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 ]. “Stepping On” aims to facilitate older persons to take control, assess coping behaviors, and motivate them to integrate falls prevention interventions in their daily life.

In Baker et al. (2007) [ 46 ], participation was described at the level of the older person and healthcare professionals. The programs was collectively developed with the older persons and healthcare professionals [ 46 ]. Environmental level According to the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods, the implementation strategies identified in the included reports aimed to change the following determinants on the environmental level: “social norms,” “social support and social networks,” “change organizations,” “change communities,” and “policy” [ 53 ]. In total, twelve implementation strategies were identified across eighteen studies (Fig. 2 ). The most frequently mentioned implementation strategies at environmental level were as follows: technical assistance ( n = 14), use of lay health workers, peer education ( n = 10), increasing stakeholders influence ( n = 8), forming coalitions ( n = 8), and participatory problem-solving ( n = 7). The Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods defined technical assistance as providing technical means to achieve desired behavior [ 53 ]. Fourteen studies used technical assistance as an implementation strategy, including training of the program deliverers (actors) and development and dissemination of supportive materials and tools (e.g., handbooks, flyers, assessment tools) [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 48 ]. In addition, three studies offered financial support to healthcare professionals and older persons [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 43 ]. The strategy use of lay health workers and peer education (i.e., mobilizing members of the target population to serve as boundary spanners, credible sources of information and role models) [ 53 ] had been applied by ten studies [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 3", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 17}}

In “Step by Step,” the researchers recruited nurses, experienced in providing community care, and near age peers with the senior center population, as interventionists [ 46 ]. Kittipimpanon et al. (2012) involved community members (e.g., housewives, members of a senior club) in the program delivery [ 47 ]. In total, eight studies used increasing stakeholders influence (i.e., increase stakeholder power, legitimacy, and urgency, often by forming coalitions and using community development and social action to change an organization’s policies) [ 53 ] and forming coalitions (i.e., forming an alliance among individuals or organizations, during which they cooperate in joint action to reach a goal in their own self-interest) [ 53 ] as implementation strategies [ 29 , 30 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 43 , 44 , 46 , 47 ]. Middlebrook et al. (2012) and Mackenzie et al. (2020) utilized “chronic disease management” to offer preventive and coordinated care for older persons. General practitioners compiled a multidisciplinary plan, together with occupational therapists and physiotherapists [ 30 , 39 ]. Developing effective partnerships and networks was also an important component of “Stay On Your Feet” and the study of Kittipimpanon et al. (2012). The researchers cooperated with health organizations, healthcare professionals, intersectoral organizations, and local councils [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 47 ].

For the development and evaluation of “InSTEP” and “Step by Step,” there was a coalition between centers of expertise in falls prevention, organizations, policy makers, and universities [ 43 , 46 ]. Seven studies [ 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 41 , 43 , 44 , 46 , 47 ] used participatory problem-solving (i.e., “diagnosing the problem, generating potential solutions, developing priorities, making an action plan and obtaining feedback after implementing the plan”) [ 53 ]. The majority of the studies ( n = 4) that used participatory problem-solving involved stakeholders (e.g., older persons, organizations, policy makers, healthcare professional) to develop, evaluate, and revise their program [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 43 , 46 , 47 ]. In three studies, the end users were consulted to translate an existing program to their context [ 31 , 41 , 44 ]. Additional implementation strategies The included studies described additional implementation strategies which could not be categorized according the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods [ 53 ]. Elley et al. (2008) and Milisen et al. (2006) described a nurse-led multifactorial falls prevention intervention where the coordination of care and follow-up was done by one person, a registered nurse [ 38 , 42 ]. In the two studies using chronic disease management , the program was set up by the Australian government allowing older persons, with multiple health problems that require multidisciplinary care, to have five Medicare funded allied health services per year [ 30 , 39 ]. Implementation theories, models, and frameworks Twelve studies used theories, models, or frameworks to develop or evaluate the programs (see Table 4 ) [ 17 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ].

First, several classic theories that originate from different fields (e.g., psychology, sociology) were identified. To increase knowledge, “Stepping On” used adult education principles [ 56 ], and “InSTEP” used the extended parallel process model [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 45 , 48 , 65 ]. In addition, “Stepping On” [ 27 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 ] used the self-efficacy theory of Bandura [ 57 ] and the decision-making process of Janis and Mann [ 58 ]. Three studies [ 17 , 29 , 46 ] used the transtheoretical model of Prochaska [ 63 ], and Kittipimpanon et al. (2012) used the Appreciation-Influence-Control Technique [ 67 ] in a workshop to involve stakeholders [ 47 ]. Next, the process models describe the different stages in the translation of research into practice. In this systematic review, three process models were identified: the Ottawa Charter for Health promotion (WHO) [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 62 ], the plan-do-study-act cycle [ 46 , 66 ], and the knowledge-to-action framework [ 29 , 59 ]. In addition, two studies used an implementation theory. In the study of Fortinsky et al. (2008), the innovation dissemination theory of Berwick [ 64 ] was used to achieve organizational change [ 17 ]. In the iSOLVE project, the Behaviour Change Wheel and normalization process theory were used as implementation theories [ 29 , 60 , 61 ]. The PRECEDE–PROCEED framework [ 68 ] was identified in one study and can be categorized as an evaluation framework [ 47 ]. In addition, Mora Pinzon et al. [ 31 ] used the RE-AIM framework [ 69 ], and Mahoney et al. [ 41 ] used a root cause analysis to evaluate the implementation project. Lastly, no determinant frameworks were described in the included studies.

Unlike previous research, this review did not focus on the effectiveness of the falls prevention interventions [ 11 ]. It focused on the inconsistency between efficacy and effectiveness testing by gaining insight into how multifactorial falls prevention interventions were currently translated into clinical practice. We explored the strategies used to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community and provided a synthesis of the implementation strategies following the “Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods; an Intervention Mapping Approach” [ 53 ]. The majority of the studies described implementation strategies on multiple levels of the context (i.e., older person, healthcare professional, organization, community, policy/society). It is remarkable that implementation strategies were mainly described at the level of the older person and healthcare professional (i.e., individual level). At individual level, we notice that combining tailored implementation strategies, active involvement, and participation are often used to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions. At the level of the organization, community, and policy/society (i.e., environmental level), it is recognizable that technical assistance and stakeholder involvement are key implementation strategies. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights two key findings. First, we found that the majority of the studies did not describe the multifactorial falls prevention intervention, implementation strategies, and development of the programs in detail. The included studies used a variety of labels for implementation strategies and lacked operational definitions, increasing the difficulty to gain full insight", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 21}}

The included studies used a variety of labels for implementation strategies and lacked operational definitions, increasing the difficulty to gain full insight into the underlying mechanisms of actions for behaviour change [ 52 , 53 ]. No studies described the use of taxonomies or reporting guidelines. To improve the reporting of the content of behaviour change strategies, it is advised to use guidelines (e.g., Proctor et al.’s recommendations for specifying and reporting implementation strategies, the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) Statement, or the Workgroup for Intervention Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER)) [ 52 , 70 , 71 , 72 ]. In addition, for conceptual clarity, it is emphasized to use a taxonomy such as the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods, the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy, or the Behaviour Change Wheel, to label implementation strategies [ 52 , 53 , 73 , 74 , 75 ]. In this review, the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods of Kok and colleagues was used, due to its clear links to theory and determinants of practice for its interventions [ 53 ]. However, we found that the taxonomy did not give a complete overview of implementation strategies. Additional strategies were identified such as “coordination of care” and “support by the government.” There was also no fit with other taxonomies (e.g., Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy, the Behaviour Change Wheel, EPOC Taxonomy) [ 52 , 53 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 76 ]. In addition, we also found that the distinction between individual and environmental level, made in the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods, was often too strict. As mentioned in the results, some strategies were not only found at individual level but also at the level of the organization, community, policy/society (e.g., belief selection, persuasive communicat", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 22}}

The same remark can be made for the strategies on environmental level. They were also found at the level of the older person and healthcare professional (e.g., technical assistance, use of lay health workers, peer education, increasing stakeholder influence). It can be questioned if the distinction between strategies at individual and environmental level is necessary. Other taxonomies with a clear link to theory and determinants such as the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy do not make such a distinction. The second key finding is that solely twelve studies used implementation theories, models, and frameworks, and no studies described neither the use of a determinant framework (e.g., TICD checklist, CFIR) nor how the implementation strategy targeted influencing factors. We also found that the twelve studies that used implementation theories, models, or frameworks for program development did not clearly described how the theories were translated in practical applications in a way that maintained the active mechanisms for effectiveness [ 77 , 78 ]. Studies show that there is a great value in effectively using implementation frameworks, models, and theories [ 53 , 54 , 79 ]. They can provide a uniform language and inform theoretical thinking and the design, conduct, and evaluation of studies. Implementation theories have directional relationships between determinants; therefore, they can guide what can or cannot work. Suboptimal use of implementation frameworks, models, and theories can impact the success of the implementation efforts, resulting in wasted resources, development of inappropriate implementation strategies, and wrong conclusions [ 53 , 54 , 79 ].

A systematic review on the use of theory in the design of implementation strategies concluded that only 22.5% of the included studies used theories [ 80 ]. Mixed results in implementation studies are often attributed to either limited or no theoretical underpinning [ 54 ]. Implementation is a dynamic and context-specific process. Each level of the context demands individual tailoring of implementation strategies. Therefore, assessment of influencing factors by means of a determinant framework is crucial, including using the results to select suitable theories and adapt implementation strategies for the specific context [ 53 , 54 , 79 ]. An example of a systematic approach to plan a health promotion program is the study of Vandervelde et al. (2021) on reducing the use of physical restraints in home care. The authors developed and evaluated a multicomponent program to support the implementation of a guideline [ 81 ]. By using intervention mapping, they ensured that the program was theoretical, empirical, and practical grounded. During this process, the authors obtained insight into the problem, the behaviour of healthcare professionals, the environment, and the determinants. Together with a stakeholder group, the authors selected theory and evidence-based methods to influence selected determinants; those methods were translated into practical applications (e.g., flyer, tutorials, ambassador for restraint-free home care) [ 81 ]. This review found that in falls prevention research, there is still a gap in the detailed description of implementation strategies and the effective use of implementation frameworks, models, and theories, making it difficult to know what does and does not work and to compare and replicate studies.

After all, a comprehensive search strategy was developed in close collaboration with experts of the biomedical library of the university. In addition, during this whole process, the PRISMA statement was followed [ 21 ]. A narrative synthesis was performed following the “Guidance on the conduct of Narrative synthesis in Systematic Reviews.” Next, the methods and results of this review were discussed with a group of 21 stakeholders. The stakeholder group recognized the study findings and supported the identified implementation strategies (e.g., tailoring, personalize risk, active learning, consciousness raising). Lastly, this review followed the Proctor et al.’s (2013) recommendations for specifying and reporting implementation strategies and the Taxonomy of Behavioral Change Methods [ 52 , 53 ]. In addition, TIDIeR was used to extract data on the multifactorial falls prevention interventions and implementation strategies, and the taxonomy of Per Nilsen was used to categorize the implementation theories, models, and frameworks [ 50 , 54 ]. As already mentioned, the use of guidelines and taxonomies improves conceptual clarity, comprehensiveness, and study replication [ 20 ]. This review has some limitations. Despite a comprehensive search strategy, we did identify additional studies from reference lists of systematic reviews and included reports (see Fig. 1 ). A possible explanation is that we did not search for gray literature, and we did not perform forward snowballing. It is possible that studies were missed. Another limitation is the possibility of publication bias. It is likely that studies with negative results were not published. Lastly, heterogeneity was high in terms of study design, setting, multifactorial falls prevention interventions, imp", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_text\\Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "file_name": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi.txt", "parent_id": "Strategies to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions in communi", "chunk_index": 25}}

Lastly, heterogeneity was high in terms of study design, setting, multifactorial falls prevention interventions, implementation strategies, and outcomes. This heterogeneity limited the extent to which data could be synthesized. In addition, the level of description of the implementation strategies used in the reports was poor. This has complicated the categorization of implementation strategies following the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change Methods [ 53 ]. To impede this limitation, two researchers categorized the implementations strategies independently. Due to the heterogeneity, we could not take the results of the sensitivity analysis into account in the data synthesis (i.e., giving more weight to reports with a higher score on relevance to the research question and methodological quality). Conclusions This systematic review highlights gaps in the detailed description of implementation strategies and the effective use of implementation frameworks, models, and theories; this can be resolved by using reporting guidelines and taxonomies. In addition, the review found that studies mainly focused on implementation strategies at the level of the older person and healthcare professional. These studies emphasize the importance of tailoring, consciousness raising, and participation in the implementation process of multifactorial falls prevention interventions. Studies using implementation strategies at the level of the organization, community, and policy/society show that technical assistance, actively involving stakeholders and forming coalitions, are important strategies.

Abstract Background: falls and fall-related injuries are common in older adults, have negative effects both on quality of life and functional independence and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Current clinical approaches and advice from falls guidelines vary substantially between countries and settings, warranting a standardised approach. At the first World Congress on Falls and Postural Instability in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in December 2019, a worldwide task force of experts in falls in older adults, committed to achieving a global consensus on updating clinical practice guidelines for falls prevention and management by incorporating current and emerging evidence in falls research. Moreover, the importance of taking a person-centred approach and including perspectives from patients, caregivers and otherstakeholderswasrecognisedasimportantcomponentsofthisendeavour.Finally,theneedtospecificallyincluderecent developmentsine-healthwasacknowledged,aswellastheimportanceofaddressingdifferencesbetweensettingsandincluding developingcountries.

Fielding, PhD, FGSA (Medical Sciences Section) Abstract Background: Falls are a common cause of injury, hospitalization, functional decline, and residential care admission among older adults. Cardiovascular disorders are recognized risk factors for falls. This systematic review assesses the association between cardiovascular disorders and falls in older adults. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted on MEDLINE and Embase, encompassing all literature published prior to December 31, 2022. Included studies addressed persons aged 50 years and older, and assessed the association between cardiovascular disorders and falls or the efficacy of cardiovascular-based interventions to reduce falls. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality utilizing a modified Newcastle–Ottawa scale for observational studies, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for interventional studies.

A systematic narra- tive analysis of all cardiovascular outcomes, and meta-analyses of unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were performed. Results: One hundred and eighty-four studies were included: 181 observational and 3 interventional. Several cardiovascular disorders, including stroke, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, arterial stiffness, arrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension, and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, were consistently associated with falls. In meta-analysis of unadjusted ORs, the largest positive pooled associations with falls during a 12-month reporting interval were for stroke (OR: 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70–2.11), peripheral arterial disease (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.12–2.95), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.27–1.82), and orthostatic hypotension (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.18–1.64). Conclusions: Several cardiovascular disorders are associated with falls. These results suggest the need to incorporate cardiovascular assess- ments for patients with falls. This review informed the cardiovascular recommendations in the new World Guidelines for falls in older adults.

Cognitiveimpairment,includingattentionalproblems,execu- tive dysfunction, and dementia, are also barriers to exercise and risk factors for falls103–105; yet cognitive impairment is often an exclusion for PD intervention studies.106 Cognitive impairment canaffectparticipation duetotheinabilitytofollowinstructions andtosetgoals.OnetrialshowedthatPDparticipantswithmild cognitive impairment had challenges in understanding scenarios outlining goals of care.107 Additional non-motor symptoms, especially anxiety, depression, and psychotic features may also affect participation in falls prevention. Fear of falling is a com- monriskfactorforfalls inPD.108 Fallsefficacyisassociated with depression, balance impairment, and use of assistive devices.109 The degree to which people perceive falls risk can influence deunitnoC 1ELBAT rohtuA tnapicitraP dna sgnidniF serusaem/emoctuO scitsiretcarahc ssalcgurD miA ngisedydutS lanruoj ecnereffidtnacfiingiS traPSRDPUhtiwderusaemsllaF 56=N cigrenilohC fostceffeezylana-eR lairtdezimodnaR namrebeiL nispuorgneewteb tiagfognizeerf,31noitseuQII tsinoga etartratibenitocin .late )%34(31:)%(n,nemoW :doireppu-wolloF stneitapfonoitroporp IItraPSRDPUhtiwderusaem enitocin( no)100CN(etardyhid 68)9102( )%06(12dnaobecalpni ydutS(.skeew01 sllafninoitcuderhtiw noisluporter,41noitseuQ )etartratib stiagfognizeerfdnasllaf tnemta", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_manual_pdf\\Movement Disord Clin Pract - 2023 - Camicioli - Prevention of Falls in Parkinson s Disease  Guidelines and Gaps.pdf", "file_name": "Movement Disord Clin Pract - 2023 - Camicioli - Prevention of Falls in Parkinson s Disease  Guidelines and Gaps.pdf", "parent_id": "Movement Disord Clin Pract - 2023 - Camicioli - Prevention of Falls in Parkinson s Disease  Guidelines and Gaps", "chunk_index": 20}}

A number of medicines can cause or contribute to falls and these are sometimes referred to as falls risk increasing drugs (FRIDs). This document highlights FRIDs and also highlights medicines that cause or contribute to fractures. Therefore, effective medication review is essential for people who are at risk of falls or fractures. Medication review in people at risk of falls is often not straight forward as people will often have multiple co-morbidities, be older and/or be living with frailty hence medicines use in this population requires a balance between the risks and benefits of multiple treatments. Therefore, this document suggests a process and areas that anyone reviewing medicines for people at risk of falls might want to think about as part of this review.

Additionally, the world falls guidelines provide a strong recommendation that when prescribing a falls risk increasing drug (FRID) to older adults this should be accompanied by an assessment of falls risk. Consider this in any setting and for low, intermediate and high-risk groups. Reference: Montero-Odasso M, van der Velde N, Martin FC et al. Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults.

Usually, the mechanism leading to a fall is one or more of: o sedation, with slowing of reaction times and impaired balance. o hypotension, including the 3 syndromes of paroxysmal hypotension – orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syndrome and vasodepressor carotid sinus hypersensitivity. o bradycardia, tachycardia or periods of asystole. • Falls may be the consequence of recent medication changes but are usually caused by medicines that have been given for some time. Medication Review Process • Medication review should be formulated in line with an established structure – an example is the Seven Steps method: o Step 1: (Aim) What matters to the patient. ▪ Identify aims and objectives of drug therapy by asking the patient ‘what matters to you?’. ▪ Explain any key information such as laboratory markers ▪ Establish treatment objectives with patient through shared decision making o Step 2: (Need) Identify essential drug therapy. ▪ Separate the list of medicines which the patient is taking ▪ Ensure patients understand the importance of essential drug therapy ▪ All medication whether herbal, prescribed or non-prescribed e.g. traditional remedies should be included o Step 3: (Need) Does the patient take unnecessary drug therapy? ▪ For the remaining drugs, it should be verified that each has a function in achieving the therapeutic goals or outcomes that matter most to the patient ▪ Review preventative treatment to ensure the patient is able to continue taking medicine for required time to gain benefit (useful tool for this process is Drug Efficacy (NNT) table). ▪ Can", "metadata": {"source_path": "browser_pdf\\NHS-Medicines-and-falls-August-2023.pdf", "file_name": "NHS-Medicines-and-falls-August-2023.pdf", "parent_id": "NHS-Medicines-and-falls-August-2023", "chunk_index": 2}}

Otherwise, the need for dose titration may also be considered. 50% of patients taking four or more medicines don’t take them as prescribed. (Medication Adherence: WHO Cares?). o Step 5: (Safety) Is the patient at risk of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or suffers actual ADR? ▪ The presence of ADRs can sometimes be identified from laboratory data (e.g. hypokalaemia from diuretic use) ▪ The patient may report such symptoms (including drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, but also the patient’s ability to self-medicate) ▪ Ask the patient specific questions (e.g. about the presence of anticholinergic symptoms, dizziness or drowsiness). If patient is experiencing ADRs, use Yellow Card Reporting o Step 6: (Efficiency) Is drug therapy cost-effective? ▪ Opportunities for cost minimisation should be explored, but changing drugs for cost reasons should only be considered if effectiveness, safety or adherence would not be comprised. ▪ Ensure prescribing is in line with current formulary recommendations o Step 7: (Patient-Centred) Is the patient willing and able to take drug therapy as intended? ▪ Does the patient understand the outcome of the review? ▪ Ensure drug therapy is tailored to patient preferences ▪ Agree and communicate plan with patient and/or welfare proxy Even if adult lacks capacity, adults with Incapacity Act still requires that the adult's views are sought. \"Adults with Incapacity Documentation\" in place.

Check if the person has a blood pressure or HbA1c target. If the person has a target, is it appropriate for the person’s goals, age, function, other co-morbidities and prognosis? There is no evidence-based international consensus on BP targets for older people including frail older people. NICE currently recommends measuring standing as well as seated blood pressure in people with hypertension who are aged 80 and over or with Type 2 Diabetes or with symptoms of postural hypotension. • BP Targets For adults with hypertension aged under 80, reduce clinic blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. For adults with hypertension aged 80 and over, reduce clinic blood pressure to below 150/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see also NICE's guideline on multimorbidity Overview | Multimorbidity: clinical assessment and management | Guidance | NICE). Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see also NICE's guideline on multimorbidity Overview | Multimorbidity: clinical assessment and management | Guidance | NICE) which may mean accepting higher blood pressure especially if the older person is experiencing symptoms suggestive of postural hypotension; if they are struggling with their existing medicines burden (particularly if they are already taking several antihypertensives) and if they have limited life expectancy.

Aggressive blood pressure treatment in older people especially those living with frailty can have unintended consequences such as orthostatic hypotension that may induce falls. • HbA1c Targets For adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). A decision aid is available from NICE Patient decision aid | Type 2 diabetes in adults: management | Guidance | NICE Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are older or frailer, if: • they are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy • tight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of their job • intensive management would not be appropriate, for example if they have significant comorbidities. If adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.

Methods: Umbrella review of narrative‑ and systematic reviews with or without meta‑analyses of all study types. Reviews that focused on older adults in any settings and included validated instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility were included. Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers undertook title, abstract, and full text screening independently. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardised spreadsheet and a narrative syn‑ thesis presented for each assessment tool. Results: Among 2736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta‑analyses. Reviews were pri‑ marily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were: Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual task assessments, single leg stance, functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that no single gait, balance or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty.

Guidelines recommend the use of multifactorial falls prevention interventions. However, these interventions are difficult to implement into the commu- nity. This systematic review aimed to explore strategies used to implement multifactorial falls prevention interventions into the community. Methods A systematic search in PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science (core col- lection), and Cochrane Library was performed and updated on the 25th of August, 2022. Studies reporting on the evaluation of implementation strategies for multifactorial falls prevention interventions in the community setting were included. Two reviewers independently performed the search, screening, data extraction, and synthesis process (PRISMA flow diagram). The quality of the included reports was appraised by means of a sensitivity analysis, assessing the relevance to the research question and the methodological quality (Mixed Method Appraisal Tool). Implementa- tion strategies were reported according to Proctor et al.’s (2013) guideline for specifying and reporting implementa- tion strategies and the Taxonomy of Behavioral Change Methods of Kok et al. (2016). Results Twenty-three reports (eighteen studies) met the inclusion criteria, of which fourteen reports scored high and nine moderate on the sensitivity analysis.

All studies combined implementation strategies, addressing different determinants. The most frequently used implementation strategies at individual level were “tailoring,” “active learning,” “personalize risk,” “individualization,” “consciousness raising,” and “participation.” At environmental level, the most often described strategies were “technical assistance,” “use of lay health workers, peer education,” “increasing stakeholder influence,” and “forming coalitions.” The included studies did not describe the implementation strategies in detail, and a variety of labels for implementation strategies were used. Twelve studies used implementation theories, models, and frameworks; no studies described neither the use of a determinant framework nor how the implementation strategy targeted influencing factors. Conclusions This review highlights gaps in the detailed description of implementation strategies and the effective use of implementation frameworks, models, and theories. The review found that studies mainly focused on imple- mentation strategies at the level of the older person and healthcare professional, emphasizing the importance of *Correspondence: Koen Milisen koen.milisen@kuleuven.be Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author(s) 2023.
